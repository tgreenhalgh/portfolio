This was a one week project where I, and three others on my team, were given specifications
and set loose to build it. I build out the backend using node and express, deployed to
zeit.co, and used AWS for hosting our PostgreSQL database.


My code can be found [here](https://github.com/mentor-me-lambda-build-week-2/back-end).

The deployed app has been taken down to save on AWS fees.
