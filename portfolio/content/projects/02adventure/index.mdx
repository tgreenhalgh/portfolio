This was a five week project where I, and three others on my team, were given specifications
and set loose to build it. We decided to really stretch ourselves and went with a stack that 
was new to all of us. The tradeoff (I have learned that each and every choice in programming
entails a tradeoff) was that, while it was more pressure, we learned a huge amount in a short
time and our app didn't have all of the features we had hoped to implement.
If curious, you can read about the process of building this app at my
[blog](https://tgreenhalgh.netlify.com/week-01/) of the project.
